Why the difference between Pointer and References?

- Safety:  References provide a safer alternative to pointers because they cannot be null and must be initialized, reducing the risk of null pointer dereferencing.
- Simplicity:  References are easier to use and understand in many cases, especially for function arguments and return values.
- Flexibility:  Pointers offer more flexibility, such as the ability to point to different objects and to be used in complex data structures.
